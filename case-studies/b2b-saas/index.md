## Conclusion
- In the first three months after Clinet signed up, our focus was solely on building backlinks. While this provided some foundational authority, the impact on traffic was minimal.

The real breakthrough came when we addressed the core SEO issues:

- Restructured the site architecture for better crawlability

- Optimised page speed to improve Core Web Vitals

- Implemented on-page SEO best practices

- Developed and optimised content targeting high-intent, low-competition keywords

- With the technical and content groundwork complete, the website finally had the fuel to compete for top Google rankings.
