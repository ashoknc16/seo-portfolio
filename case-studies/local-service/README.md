## Case Study: Reviving an Edu-Tech Website Post-Google Core Update

## - About the Client
An established Edu-Tech platform with 7+ years in the industry, consistently growing its organic visibility by publishing high-quality daily content. Over time, they successfully outranked major competitors and secured top positions in their niche.

## - The Challenge
In May 2020, Google’s Broad Core Update hit the site hard, causing a significant decline in organic traction. With their previous SEO agency unable to pinpoint the cause or reverse the drop, the client turned to us.
